This repository creates 2 machines with Vagrant, Saltstack and Bash:  
 - 'Elastic': machine with the Elasticsearch db: 192.168.33.99  
 - 'Go': machine with the Go app, managed by Supervisor. Ip: 192.168.33.90  

##USAGE
Install Vagrant and Virtualbox.  
Clone the repository and cd into it.  
```vagrant up```   
Connect to 192.168.33.90:8000 to run the application.  

If you need to change the ip address due an ip conflict, open the Vagrantfile and change the lines
```elastic.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.99"```
```go.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.90"```


##TODO
- Enable iptables with a Salt formula
- Improve Elasticseach configuration
- Improve Saltstack formulas


##NOTES
On Debian we added the line ```JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"``` to ```elasticsearch.in.sh```, otherwise Elasticsearch will listen only for ipv6 connections.
